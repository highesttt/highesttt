# Hi there 👋

## About Me

I've been into computers since I was 3 and started software development at 10 years old, starting with a custom plugin in Java for my own Minecraft server, which is still running to this day.\
I was also President of the Epitech Bordeaux Coding Club. which is an organization that helps students learn and practice coding through various projects and events.\
Unlike many others, I have my strong opinions about AI and its role in software development.\
\
I am more of a backend developer, but I also enjoy working on mobile applications and desktop software.\
\
I have my own VPS that I use to host my projects and experiment with new technologies.
